# customer-api
When new customer orders a hardware from a reseller’s e-commerce system, the customer data will be also pushed to Fuank’s endpoint via REST API. Fuank is also able to provide customer data to their resellers, if needed. Due to the fact, that current CRM implementation has limited functionality, part of Customer data should be stored in Cosmos DB.
post: Create customer details in salesforce and stored in Cosmos DB.
put: Update customer details in salesforce and stored in Cosmos DB.
get: Retrive the customer objects in salesforce.
